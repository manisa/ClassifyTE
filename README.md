# ClassifyTE: Stacking-based Machine Learning Framework for Hierarchical Classification of transposable 

Transposable Elements (TEs) or jumping genes are the DNA sequences that have an intrinsic capability to move within a host genome from one genomic location to another. Studies show that the presence of a TE within or adjacent to a functional gene may alter its expression. TEs can also cause an increase in the rate of mutation and can even mediate duplications and large insertions and deletions in the genome, promoting gross genetic rearrangements. Thus, the proper classification of the identified jumping genes is essential to understand their genetic and evolutionary effects in the genome. 
Here in this work we have established stacking based hierarchical classification framework to classify TE up to it super-family level.
