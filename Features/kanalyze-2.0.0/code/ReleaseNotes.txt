0.9.8
+ Added pre-count k-mer filtering to the count module.

+ Added output format to the count module GUI.
+ Added convenience scripts to run the cite module.
+ Added -m option to the stream module.
* Slight performance improvement to the sequence writer.
* DEC output format was called INT in some places. Fixed. INT is now an alias for DEC, and either will output k-mers in decimal-integer format.
* Count GUI's "Output File" field now resolves relative paths to KAnalyze's directory, not the user's home directory. This was a confusing default, and user's could not find their output.
